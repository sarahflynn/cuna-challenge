Frontend Coding Challenge

Overview
--------
Implement a small browser-based application for pre-qualifying a potential user
for a loan. 

Rationale
---------
We believe the best way to get to know a potential applicant is through their 
code and their process. However, traditional interview whiteboard/quiz style 
coding challenges often place those applicants in situations where they are not
 comfortable or capable of producing their best work. 

By participating in this process, you will be giving us an artifact that we can
review together and help us get a better feel for who you are as an engineer.
It will hopefully give us insight into how you approach your work on a real 
world problem of the type you'd face in your day to day work, and give you a 
chance to communicate your ideas and processes through a piece of work you 
wrote in your ideal work style and environment.

We appreciate you taking the time and we look forward to both of us learning
more about each other through this process.

Code Ownership
------------------
All code produced for this challenge are wholly owned by the applicant. We
have no intention to claim ownership or otherwise use this code for any purpose 
but evaluating you for hiring processes. You remain the sole copyright holder 
of this work.

Trade-offs
----------
We do not believe it is in your best interest to work long hours on this 
challenge. We don't want to waste your time or encourage a trade-off of
quality for quantity.

It is both okay and expected for you to cut corners. Things like 
authentication and configuration can be time consuming, and often implemented 
with standardized, off the shelf solutions. Where relevant, it's okay to 
hard code values and/or add code comments to indicate your thinking and 
any practices which you think would be time consuming to implement.

It is okay if the solution is not highly performant or highly available, but
it is useful to indicate how you would achieve this.

Must haves
----------
We expect all submissions to have the following:

1. Build instructions - Include a simple README or other file giving clear,
concise instructions on how to build/run your code.

2. Repeatable builds - All of engineers should be able to take your submission
and instructions and run them without any major, obvious issues.

3. Version history - Version control and history is an important part of our 
process and we expect it to be a part of yours too. We like and prefer git.

Nice to haves
-------------
These are recommended if you have the time:

1. Design docs - Explain your thinking clearly in an overview document helps us
and future readers (including yourself) better understand your thinking and your
structure.

2. Comprehensive Testing - We don't expect complete test coverage, but you should 
provide some tests for key, critical areas. This helps us see your testing strategies
 and what you think is critical. 

3. Comprehensive Error Handling - Understanding the places where errors can be thrown 
and how to deal with them is an important part of this task, but we again understand
that doing this completely could be time consuming. Feel free to detail errors 
through comments or other similar means to demonstrate your understanding.

Gotchas
--------
To be clear, many of the following issues will either reflect poorly or result 
in a no-pass from the interview team:

1. Unstructured code/Single commit - We expect any results to be reflective of
production quality, maintainable code. Writing the entirety of the challenge in a
single file, or committing it once is not reflective of that quality standard.

2. Scope Creep - An important part of professional engineering is producing a 
product that matches requirements. Submissions that go far beyond what is asked will
reduce our ability to engage with your submission and is not a good use of your 
time.

3. Re-implementing standard libraries - Spending your limited time writing lists, 
http servers, security algorithms, etc. provided by the standard library is in general
a bad idea and specifically not a good use of your time. It's okay to stick to the proven
software!

Requirements
------------
Your application should lead a user through the initial portion of qualifying
for an auto loan. It should consist of a landing page to collect basic info 
about both the car they are interested in buying and their own financial 
situation. Based on this, you should be able to make a simulated network call 
that will redirect the user to either a new account creation page or a 
disqualification notice.

The styling should be simple, plain but deliberate.

* Landing Page
The initial page should show a simple form with inputs for the following field:

  Auto Purchase Price (Currency)
  Auto Make (Text)
  Auto Model (Text)
  User Estimated Yearly Income (Currency)
  User Estimated Credit Score (Number from 300-850)

These fields are all required and should validate to type. Provide feedback to the
user when they wrong or missing. There should be space for marketing copy (Lorum Ipsem) 
and controls for moving forward.

* New Account Page
If the api call does not return a disqualification message(see below), this page 
should have a simple account creation form including:

  Username (Text)
  Password (Text)

The username should be validated as an email and password should require more than 8
characters and a number or special character. Ensure the user types their password
twice to validate their intent.

* Disqualification Page
Display a simple page with the disqualification message that comes from
the api call as well as fake information to get in contact with a customer service.
There should be no further way to get off this page or re-enter the information.

* API call
You should implement a mock fetch call for your backend communication. This call should
have the same interface as the real fetch and return a promise wrapped response object.
The response should return disqualify message (Lorum Ipsem is fine) if the purchase price
is more than 1/5th of the income or their estimated credit is below 600. Otherwise it 
should return a positive qualification flag. A `Bad Request` response should be returned 
for any auto purchase price above $1,000,000.

Technologies
------------
The primary tools you'll be expected to use at this job are modern React/Redux with Typescript.
Displaying familiarity with these is useful and encouraged. Solutions that stray too far 
will not be considered.

Questions
---------
If you have any questions on the task presented here, we encourage you to reach out to 
you representative and we will strive to get you answers in a timely fashion.

Thank you for your interest and taking the time to complete this. We know your time is
valuable and we hope this experience helps both sides get a sense of the other in a 
quicker, more efficient manner.
